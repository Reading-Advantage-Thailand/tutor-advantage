## 1. The Tutor Advantage "Win-Win" Matrix

This matrix demonstrates why the Tutor Advantage model is far more lucrative for tutors (especially with groups of 5+), while simultaneously being the most affordable and structured option for parents.

*Assumptions:*
*   **Standard Course Length:** 20 Hours
*   **Tutor Advantage Pricing:** 3,000 THB per student for the full 20-hour course (150 THB/hour).
*   **Group Size Target:** 5 Students.
*   **Tutor Commission:** Assuming a baseline 70% payout to the teaching tutor.

### 1.1 The Tutor's Perspective: Income & Effort Comparison

Use this data for **Tutor Recruitment Pitching**. It highlights how moving from traditional 1-on-1 tutoring or using predatory brokers to the Tutor Advantage group model drastically increases their hourly yield.

| Feature / Model | Traditional 1-on-1 (Freelance) | Traditional Small Group (2-3 students) | **Tutor Advantage (Group of 5)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parent's Cost per Hour** | 300 - 400 THB | 250 - 300 THB | **150 THB** *(Highly competitive)* |
| **Broker/Agency Fees** | High (Often 100% of Month 1) | Medium - High | **0 THB** *(Zero upfront fees)* |
| **Curriculum Prep Time** | High (Tutor builds from scratch) | High | **Low** *(Provided Origins/Quest curriculum)* |
| **Location / Space** | Travel to student's home / Cafe | Café or Rented space | **Provided Class Space** *(or Online/Local)* |
| **Gross Revenue (20 Hrs)** | 6,000 - 8,000 THB | 10,000 - 15,000 THB | **15,000 THB** *(3,000 x 5 students)* |
| **Net Tutor Income (20 Hrs)** | ~4,000 - 6,000 THB *(after broker)* | ~8,000 - 11,000 THB | **~10,500 THB** *(Assuming 70% share)* |
| **Effective Hourly Wage** | **~200 - 300 THB / hr** | **~400 - 550 THB / hr** | **~525+ THB / hr** *(Highest yield for time)* |
| **Residual Income Potential** | None. Stop teaching = 0 income. | None. | **Massive.** Earn % from downline tutors. |

**The Pitch to Tutors:**
> *"Why work twice as hard to earn less? With Tutor Advantage, you stop paying broker fees, stop wasting hours building lesson plans, and start earning over 500 Baht an hour by teaching groups of 5. Plus, if you recruit other tutors, you earn from their classes too. We even help with the classroom space."*

### 1.2 The Parent's Perspective: Value & Cost Comparison

Use this data for **Parent-Facing Marketing (Social Media/LINE)**. Parents want quality, structure, and affordability. Group classes at this price point offer massive value.

| Feature / Model | Premium 1-on-1 Tutor | Mid-Tier Local Cram School | **Tutor Advantage (Small Group)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Price per 20-Hour Course** | 6,000 - 8,000 THB | 4,000 - 5,000 THB | **3,000 THB** *(Affordable, flat rate)* |
| **Price per Hour** | 300 - 400 THB | 200 - 250 THB | **150 THB** *(Best value)* |
| **Class Size** | 1 Student | 10 - 20+ Students | **Max 5-8 Students** *(Personalized attention)* |
| **Curriculum Quality** | Varies wildly by tutor | Standardized | **Standardized & Proven** *(Origins + Quest)* |
| **Payment Method** | Cash / Direct Bank Transfer | Cash / Bank Transfer | **Secure PromptPay QR** *(via LINE)* |
| **Student Environment** | Isolated | Overcrowded | **Collaborative, engaging small groups** |

**The Pitch to Parents:**
> *"Give your child premium, structured English education without the premium price tag. For only 150 Baht an hour, your child learns in an engaging, small group environment (max 5-8 students) with a vetted professional using our proven curriculum. Easy, secure PromptPay enrollment right from your LINE app."*

## 2. Incentive Lever: Driving 5+ Student Groups

To push tutors to maximize group sizes (which improves unit economics and classroom dynamics), we use physical space as the ultimate lever.

**The "Classroom Access" Incentive:**
*   *"Groups of 1-3: Teach anywhere you like using our platform (Cafes, Online, etc.)."*
*   *"Groups of 5+: Unlock free (or heavily subsidized) access to our premium Tutor Advantage physical classroom spaces."*

**Psychological Impact:** This forces the tutor to hustle to fill those 2 extra seats so they get a professional space to teach in. A professional space elevates their perceived value, making it easier for them to recruit *more* students and build their downline agency.

## 3. Facebook & LINE Marketing Plan

Thailand is a social-first market. Acquisition relies on leveraging Facebook for discovery and LINE for conversion, retention, and referral mechanics.

### 3.1 Funnel Architecture

1.  **Awareness (Facebook):** Broad targeting to Parents (for students) and University/Freelance demographics (for tutors).
2.  **Consideration (Facebook Messenger / LINE OA):** Automated chat responses explaining the value prop.
3.  **Conversion (LINE LIFF):** Seamless enrollment and PromptPay checkout via the Tutor Advantage LIFF app.
4.  **Retention/Referral (LINE OA):** Notifications, class updates, and easy sharing of referral links.

### 3.2 Parent Acquisition Strategy (B2C)

**Objective:** Drive student enrollments into tutor-led classes.

*   **Facebook Ads:**
    *   **Creative:** Short, dynamic videos showing engaging small group classes (origins/quest curriculum). Highlighting the "150 THB/hr" value.
    *   **Targeting:** Parents aged 25-45, living in targeted urban/suburban areas, interests in education, parenting, and specific schools.
    *   **Call to Action (CTA):** "Send Message" or "Learn More" linking directly to the LINE Official Account (OA).
*   **LINE OA (The Conversion Hub):**
    *   **Rich Menu:** Clear buttons for "Find a Class," "View Curriculum," "Pricing," and "Contact Support."
    *   **Automated Flows:** When a parent clicks "Find a Class," route them to the LIFF app to browse available tutors/classes in their area.
    *   **Broadcasts:** Monthly updates on new curriculum levels or new classes opening nearby.
*   **Tutor-Led Social Selling:**
    *   Provide tutors with branded graphics and copy templates to post on their *personal* Facebook profiles and local community Facebook Groups (e.g., "Mothers of Sukhumvit").
    *   The CTA is always their unique class-bound referral link that opens the LIFF app.

### 3.3 Tutor Recruitment Strategy (B2B / MLM)

**Objective:** Recruit "Aspiring Tutors" and "Veteran/Agency" builders.

*   **Facebook Ads:**
    *   **Creative (Aspiring):** "Earn 500+ Baht/hr teaching English. We provide the curriculum and the students. Start your micro-business today."
    *   **Creative (Veteran):** "Stop paying broker fees. Build your own tutoring agency. Earn from your teaching and get residual income from the tutors you train."
    *   **Targeting:** University students, recent graduates, current teachers, interests in freelance, side-hustle, network marketing.
    *   **CTA:** "Apply Now" linking to a dedicated landing page or a specific LINE OA onboarding flow.
*   **LINE OA Onboarding Flow:**
    *   Automated sequence verifying their English proficiency and location.
    *   Delivery of the "Tutor Advantage Pitch Deck" (using data from the matrix above).
*   **The "Agency" Push:**
    *   Once a tutor successfully runs their first 5-student class, automatically trigger a LINE message: *"Congratulations! You're clearly a great teacher. Want to double your income? Invite a friend to teach using your referral code, and earn X% of their class revenue."*

### 3.4 Operational Alignment

*   **PromptPay is King:** Ensure the LINE LIFF app integrates flawlessly with Omise PromptPay. Friction here kills conversions.
*   **Notification Triggers:** Implement LINE OA transactional notifications for:
    *   Successful payment (Parent)
    *   New student enrolled (Tutor)
    *   Commission payout approved (Tutor/Upline)
*   **Legacy QR Support:** Ensure physical workbooks with QR codes seamlessly open the LIFF app and route to the correct digital asset or fallback page.

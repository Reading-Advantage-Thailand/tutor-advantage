# Current Task: Database Setup - Phase 1 Complete

## Current Status

Initial database setup for development is complete. PostgreSQL setup on GCP will be addressed during MVP deployment phase.

## Completed Objectives

1. ✓ Set up local SQLite database for development
2. ✓ Install and configure Prisma ORM
3. ✓ Design and implement initial schema
4. ✓ Set up database migrations workflow
5. ✓ Create and run seed data scripts

## Implemented Features

### Database Schema

- User management with roles
- MLM network structure
- Course and lesson management
- Progress tracking
- Revenue and commission tracking
- Internationalization support

### Development Environment

- Local SQLite database configured
- Prisma ORM integration complete
- Migration system established
- Seed data script implemented

### Sample Data Created

- Admin user
- Sample tutor with profile
- Sample student with profile
- Sample course with lessons
- Basic progress tracking
- Example translations

## Deferred Tasks (For MVP Deployment)

1. PostgreSQL on Google Cloud SQL:

   - Instance creation
   - Network configuration
   - Security setup
   - Migration from SQLite

2. Connection Pooling:
   - Pool configuration
   - Performance optimization
   - Monitoring setup

## Technical Documentation

### Local Development Setup

- Database URL: `file:./dev.db`
- Schema: See `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Seed Data: See `prisma/seed.ts`

### Schema Adaptations

- Enums implemented as strings
- JSON fields stored as stringified text
- Arrays stored as comma-separated strings

### Commands

- Generate Prisma Client: `npx prisma generate`
- Create Migration: `npx prisma migrate dev`
- Reset Database: `npx prisma migrate reset`
- Seed Data: `npx prisma db seed`

## Next Steps

1. Continue with MVP development using local SQLite database
2. Document any schema changes needed during development
3. Plan PostgreSQL migration strategy for deployment phase
4. Maintain list of optimization opportunities for production

## Future Considerations

### Production Database Setup

- Instance sizing and scaling
- High availability configuration
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Monitoring and alerting

### Security Planning

- Database encryption
- Access control
- Network security
- Audit logging

### Performance Optimization

- Index optimization
- Query performance
- Connection management
- Caching strategy

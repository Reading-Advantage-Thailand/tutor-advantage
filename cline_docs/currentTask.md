4. Pull Request Creation
5. Review and Merge Process
6. Branch Cleanup

## Context

This task is part of Phase 1: Foundation Setup, focusing on establishing proper version control practices. This is critical for:

- Maintaining code quality through proper review processes
- Ensuring consistent development practices
- Tracking feature implementation and bug fixes
- Facilitating team collaboration

## Progress

- [x] Document GitHub Flow process
- [x] Create issue template
- [x] Create pull request template
- [x] Configure conventional commits
- [x] Set up commit message validation
- [x] Create git workflow documentation
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Set up automated checks for PRs

## Next Steps

1. Set up branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings
2. Configure GitHub Actions for automated checks
3. Create contributing guidelines
4. Add code of conduct
5. Test workflow with sample PR
6. Create team training materials

## Technical Considerations

- Branch protection rules need repository admin access
- CI/CD integration pending for automated checks
- Team training materials needed for workflow adoption
- Documentation should be kept updated as workflow evolves
